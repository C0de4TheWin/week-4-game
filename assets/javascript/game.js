//I need to set up the randomly generated number between 19 - 120

//at the start of the game







//I need to add a random value of 1-12 to each of the 4 crystals


//when user clicks on crystal it will add specific number of points
//to score


//game will hide this amount of points until crystal is clicked


//player wins if their total score matchs random number

//player loses if score goes above random number


//game restarts upon win/loss

//when a new game begins the player should get a new random number


//all 4 crystals will have new values each game


//score and score counter will reset to 0


//app should show number of games the player wins and loses
